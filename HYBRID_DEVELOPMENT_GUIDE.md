# Hybrid Development Setup: Cursor + Replit

## Method 1: Replit as Development Server Only

### Setup Steps:
1. **Keep coding in Cursor** (your main development environment)
2. **Use Replit only for running servers** (backend + frontend)
3. **Sync code changes** between Cursor and Replit

### Workflow:
```bash
# In Cursor (your local machine):
# 1. Write code normally
# 2. When ready to test, push to GitHub

# In Replit:
# 1. Pull latest changes from GitHub
# 2. Run servers: npm run dev:replit
# 3. Test your application
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Use Cursor's AI features
- ✅ Zero local RAM/CPU usage for servers
- ✅ Keep your preferred development environment
- ✅ Test on cloud infrastructure

## Method 2: GitHub Codespaces (Better Integration)

### Setup Steps:
1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Open Codespaces** (browser-based VS Code)
3. **Use Codespaces for both coding and running servers**

### Workflow:
```bash
# In GitHub Codespaces:
# 1. Code with VS Code features (similar to Cursor)
# 2. Run servers locally in Codespaces
# 3. Access via public URLs
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Full VS Code experience (closest to Cursor)
- ✅ AI coding assistance available
- ✅ Zero local resource usage
- ✅ Better integration than Replit

## Method 3: Cursor + Cloud Development

### Setup Steps:
1. **Use Cursor for coding** (local)
2. **Deploy to Vercel/Netlify** (frontend)
3. **Deploy backend to Railway/Render** (backend)

### Workflow:
```bash
# In Cursor:
# 1. Develop normally
# 2. Push to GitHub

# Auto-deployment:
# 1. Frontend deploys to Vercel
# 2. Backend deploys to Railway
# 3. Test on live URLs
```

## Comparison:

| Method | Cursor Integration | Resource Usage | Setup Complexity |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Replit Hybrid** | Partial | 0% local | Easy |
| **GitHub Codespaces** | Full | 0% local | Medium |
| **Cloud Deployment** | Full | 0% local | Hard |

## Recommendation:
**Start with GitHub Codespaces** - it gives you the closest experience to Cursor while using zero local resources.
