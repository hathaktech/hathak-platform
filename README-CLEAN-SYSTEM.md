# Clean Universal Product Extraction System

## Overview
This is a clean, universal product extraction system that works with **any e-commerce website worldwide**. The system has been completely cleaned of AVVA-specific code and now provides a robust service for extracting product details from any URL.

## What Was Cleaned Up

### ‚ùå Removed AVVA-Specific Files:
- `backend/controllers/avvaExtractor.js`
- `backend/debug-avva.js`
- `backend/debug-avva-detailed.js`
- `backend/test-avva.js`
- `backend/test-comprehensive.js`
- `backend/quick-test.js`
- `backend/test-universal-extractor.js`
- `backend/EXTRACTION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
- `backend/PRODUCT_EXTRACTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `backend/UNIVERSAL_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`

### ‚ùå Removed AVVA References:
- Cleaned up `backend/routes/productExtractorRoutes.js`
- Cleaned up `backend/controllers/simpleProductExtractor.js`
- Cleaned up `frontend/src/components/buyme/UnifiedProductLinkInput.tsx`
- Updated frontend API route to use main backend server

## Current System Architecture

### Backend (Port 5000)
- **Main Extractor**: `simplifiedUniversalExtractor.js` - Clean universal extraction
- **Fallback Strategy**: Multiple extraction methods for any website
- **Response Format**: Only the 4 required fields (title, price, image, colors, sizes, storeUrl)

### Frontend (Port 3000)
- **Input Component**: Clean URL input with universal store detection
- **Modal Display**: Beautiful product details modal with extracted data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to manual entry when extraction fails

## How It Works

### 1. User Pastes Any Product URL
```javascript
// User inputs any e-commerce URL
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW
https://www.zara.com/us/en/product-name-p123.html
https://www.shein.com/product-details.html
https://any-store.com/HatHakStore/item-123
```

### 2. Multi-Strategy Extraction
The system tries 4 extraction strategies in order:

1. **Structured Data** (JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa)
2. **Meta Tags** (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
3. **Smart Selectors** (Common e-commerce patterns)
4. **Heuristics** (Generic HTML analysis)

### 3. Normalized Response
Returns only the essential fields:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Product Title",
    "price": "$99.99",
    "image": "https://store.com/image.jpg",
    "colors": ["Black", "White", "Blue"],
    "sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"],
    "storeUrl": "https://store.com/product-url"
  }
}
```

### 4. Customer Experience
- **Beautiful Modal**: Large product image with gallery
